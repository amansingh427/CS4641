    "Homework 2 will have two components to it: The programming portion in this Jupyter notebook along with the theory questions provided in this notebook. The homework is worth a total of 150 points, where 50 of these are bonus points. The grading breakdown is as follows:\n",
    " \n",
    "1. Programming (84+35 bonus): problems 1 (parts 1-4(A)),3 (parts 1-2), 4 (parts 1,3 and 4) \n",
    "2. Theory (11+15 bonus): problems 1.4(B), 2, 3.3 and 4.2\n",

    "\n",
    "- We will be using Gradescope this semester for submission and grading of assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For the written (non-programming) part of the assignment\n",
    "    - Your write up must be submitted in PDF form, you may use either Latex or markdown, whichever you prefer. We will not accept hand-written work.\n",
    "    - Please make sure to start answering each question on a new page. It makes it more organized to map your answers on GradeScope. When submitting your assignment, you must correctly map pages of your PDF to each question/subquestion where they appear. Improperly mapped questions may not be graded correctly.\n",

    "- Early Bird Special: If you can submit one of the coding assignment files (kmeans.py or gmm.py) by September 23rd, you get a bonus of 5 points for this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make your submission as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -Questions 1.4,2.1: Submit it in \"A2 Written\" assignment of gradescope in .pdf format\n",
    "\n",
    "    -Question 2.2,3.3,4.2: Submit it in \"A2 Bonus Written\" assignment of gradescope in .pdf format\n",
    "\n",
    "    - To create a pdf of your jupyter notebook, on the top left hand corner click on \"File\"->\"Download as\"->\"HTML (.html)\". As the HTML file on your system and open it (it will open up a browser). Now hit \"CTRL + P\" and save the file as a PDF. \n",
    "\n",
    "    -When uploading the pdf for the written portion of the assignment, please map the questions to pages where your solution begins (as was done for assignment 1).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -Submit the programming solutions to their respective folders on gradescope as per the instructions given below\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using the autograder\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will submit your code (.py files) for the autograder in the following folders:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - \"A2 Programming\":\n",
    "        * kmeans.py\n",

    "        * kmeans.py\n",
    "        * gmm.py\n",
    "\n",
    "- All you will have to do is to copy your implementations of the classes \"Kmeans\", \"GMM\", \"CleanData\", \"SemiSupervised\" onto the respective files. We provided you different .py files and we added libraries in those files please DO NOT remove those lines and add your code after those lines. Note that these are the only allowed libraries that you can use for the homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You are allowed to make as many submissions until the deadline as you like. Additionally, note that the autograder tests each function separately, therefore it can help you identify which function might have an issue in your implementation, however, you are encouraged to debug your code locally on the Python notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For the \"HW2 - Non-programming\" part, you will create a pdf (as was done for the theory portion of assignment 1) and submit it on Gradescope. The non-programming part corresponds to Q1.4, Q2, Q3.3 (both your response and the generated images with your implementation) and Q4.2.**"
