you have been interested in the development of a long term natural gas model for use in the ets revenue management effort i agree that the ability to model various supply demand scenarios for north america should prove useful in ets business development efforts and in particular in predicting the impact of the new large alaskan gas supplies on the n a pipeline grid as you know vince kaminski feels that a software product developed by dale nesbitt marketpoint inc of los altos hills ca may be a good choice and one readily available in a relatively short time marketpoint has proposed that they work with us in our offices for a week of intensive training and testing so we can make a more informed decision before ordering the software they have proposed a charge of 12 000 plus expenses for the one week session with that cost applied to the first year s subscription price approx 55 60 m yr should we decide to go forward the other details timing ene resources required necessary it interface etc still need to be worked out but i believe there is generally a consensus to proceed with the test with my recent relocation to the clean fuels group i will no longer be responsible for the alaskan pipeline development however danny mccarty is pulling together a team consisting of people from nng nbp and elsewhere in ets to push the project forward i believe eric gadd will be playing a key role as well the decision on the long term gas model should appropriately be made by the new project team i have attached a draft of the proposed marketpoint license agreement it has not yet been fully reviewed by legal or by shelley c for the affiliate issues let me know if i can provide any other background or assistance jng"]}
