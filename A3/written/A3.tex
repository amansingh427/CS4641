\section*{1.1 Spam Detection}
Naive Bayes classification uses the formula $p(t|x)=\frac{p(x|t)p(t)}{p(x)}$, where $p(t)$ is the prior
and $p(x|t)$ is the likelihood. To find if "Your gift" is spam, we must calculate
$p(\text{spam}|\text{"your gift"}) = p(s|yg)$, which is equal to $p(s|yg)=\frac{p(yg|s)p(s)}{p(yg)}$.
Calculating the prior probabilities, we get $p(s)=\frac{2}{4}=0.5$ and $p(yg)=\frac{0}{4}=0$. Calculating the likelihood, we
get $p(yg|s)=\frac{0}{2}=0$. Now, if we try using the normal Bayes classification formula, we will get 
an undefined answer, as we would have to divide by 0. Instead, we can discard the denominator and
simnply calculate whether spam or not spam has a bigger probability, using
$p(s|yg)=p(\text{your}|s)p(\text{gift}|s)=p(y|s)p(g|s)$ and $p(!s|yg)=p(y|!s)p(g|!s)$.
To use this, we are assuming all words are independent of each other, so we are not considering sentences
at all. To avoid results of 0, we will add 1 to every probability, which should not affect the final
classification. The probabilities are as follows: \begin{align*}
    p(y|s) &= \frac{0+1}{3+5} &= \frac{1}{8} \\
    p(y|!s) &= \frac{0+1}{4+5} &= \frac{1}{9} \\
    p(g|s) &= \frac{2+1}{3+5} &= \frac{3}{8} \\
    p(g|!s) &= \frac{1+1}{4+5} &= \frac{2}{9} \\
    p(yg|s) &= p(y|s)p(g|s) &= \frac{1}{8}\times\frac{3}{8} &= \frac{3}{64} \\
    p(yg|!s) &= p(y|!s)p(g|!s) &= \frac{1}{9}\times\frac{2}{9} &= \frac{2}{81}
\end{align*}
Since $p(\text{"your gift"}|\text{spam})>p(\text{"your gift}|\text{not spam})$, "your gift" would be 
classified as spam.

\section*{3.2 Feature Scaling}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The change depends on the data and which column is changed. On average, it exacerbated the
            variance in the perturbed area, and made the variation proportion unusually high in the first component.
    \item This change also depends on the data and which column is changed.
    \item This does not affect the number of linearly independent components, as that is the property of
            linearly independent components; they are linearly independent of each other, regardless of any scalar
            multiplied to any column.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{4.2 About RMSE}
The RMSE should be as close to 0 as possible. Ideally, if pred and label are the same, RMSE would indeed be 0.
