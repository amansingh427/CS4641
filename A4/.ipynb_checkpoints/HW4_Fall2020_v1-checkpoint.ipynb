    "\n",
    "The perceptron is a basic function that mimics the human neuron. A single perceptron can be thought of as a linear hyperplane as in SVMs followed by a non-linear function. $$a_{i} = \\phi \\left( \\sum \\limits_{j=1}^{n} w_{ij}x_{j}+b_{i} \\right) = \\phi(w_{i}^{T}x+b_{i})$$ where $w_{i} \\in R^{n}$ is the weight vector, $x \\in R^{n}$ is ONE data point with $n$ features, $b_{i} \\in R$ is the bias element, and $\\phi(.)$ is any non linear function that will be described later. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fully-connected Layer\n",
    "Typically, a modern neural network contains millions of perceptrons as the one shown in the previous image. Preceptrons interact in different configurations. Such as cascaded or parallel. In this part we describe a fully connected layer configuration in a neural network, which uses parallel perceptrons to form a layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "We extend the previous notation to describe a fully connected layer as follows\n",
    "$$a = \\phi(Z), \\quad Z=Wx+b$$ where $Z \\in R^{m}$ is the output vector after appling linear operations, $W \\in R^{m \\times n}$ is the weight matrix, and $b \\in R^{m}$ is the bais vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can use the perceptron layer to update the data signal. The whole operation can be summarized as,\n",
    "$$a^{[l]} = \\phi(Wa^{[l-1]}+b) $$ where $a^{[l-1]}$ is the output of the previous layer as shown in figure below. Since we are going to build a two layer neural network model, $l \\in \\{1, 2\\}$ in this problem.\n",

    "## Activation Function\n",
    "There are many kinds of activation function. For this question, we are going to use Relu and Sigmoid.\n",
    "### ReLU\n",
    "The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) is one of the most commonly used activation function in neural network models. The function is $\\phi(Z)=max(0,Z)$. ReLU shares a lot of the properties of linear functions and it tends to work well on most of the problems. The only issue is that the derivative is not defined at z = 0, which we can overcome by assigning the derivative to 0 at z = 0. However, this means that for z ≤ 0 the gradient is zero and again can’t learn.\n",
    "### Sigmoid\n",
    "The sigmoid function is another non-linear function with S-shaped curve. This function is useful in the case of binary classification as its output is between 0 and 1. The mathematical form of the function is $\\phi(Z)=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-Z}}$. One of the main disadvantages for using sigmoid function on hidden layers is that the gradient is very close to zero over a large portion of its domain which makes it slow and harder for the learning algorithm to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Relu](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=10g4b7WTbt9Y9QQQ9EJhiqXhQvfEpiXLe)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cross Entropy Loss\n",
    "An essential piece in training a neural network, is the loss function. The whole purpose of gradient decent algorithm is to find some network parameters that minimizes the loss function. In this problem, we minimize Cross Entropy (CE) loss that represents the distance between true data distribution and estimated distribution by neural network. During training of the neural network, we will be looking for network parameters that minimizes this distance. The mathematical form of the CE loss is given by \n",
    "$$CE(p,q) = -\\sum\\limits_{i} p(x_{i})\\log q(x_{i}) $$\n",
    "where $p(x)$ is the true distribution and $q(x)$ is the estimated distribution. \n",
    "### Implementation details\n",
    "For binary classification problems, we have probability distribution of a label $y_{i}$:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "y_{i}= \n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "&1& \\text{ with probability } p(x_{i}) \\\\\n",
    "&0& \\text{ with probability } 1- p(x_{i})\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "A frequentist estimate of $p(x_{i})$ can be written as $p(x_{i})= \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{y_{i}}{N}$. Therefore the cross entropy for binary estimation can be written as \n",
    "$$CE(y_{i},\\hat{y_{i}}) = -\\frac{1}{N}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{N}[y_{i} \\log (\\hat{y_{i}}) +(1-y_{i}) \\log (1-\\hat{y_{i}})]$$\n",
    "where $y_{i} \\in \\{ 0,1\\}$ is the true label and $\\hat{y_{i}} \\in \\{0,1\\}$ is the estimated distribution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Forward Propagation\n",
    "We start by intializing the weights of the fully connected layer using Xavier initialization [Xavier initialization](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/glorot10a/glorot10a.pdf). During training we pass all the data points through the network layer by layer.\n",

    "Then we get the output and compute the loss \n",
    "$$l = CE(y,\\hat{y}) = -\\frac{1}{N}(y \\log (\\hat{y}) +(1-y) \\log (1-\\hat{y}))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Backward propagation\n",
    "After the forward pass, we do back propagation to update the weights and biases in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function. So we update the weights and biases using the following formulas\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "W^{[2]} := W^{[2]} - lr \\times \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial W^{[2]}} \\\\\n",

To compute $\\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial W^{[2]}}$, we need $a^{[2]}, Z^{[2]}, a^{[1]}$ calculated during forward propagation.
